Basic Trigger Testing

/* Atomic Reply

*/

- Hello human.

/* Atomic Reply
   ------------
   Human says:     what is your name
   Expected reply: You can call me RiveScript Test Bot.
*/
+ what is your name
- You can call me <bot name>.

/* Wildcards
   ---------
   Human says:     my favorite thing in the world is programming
   Expected reply: Why do you like programming so much?
*/

/* Wildcards
   ---------
   Human says:     I am twenty years old
   Expected reply: Tell me that as a number instead of spelled out like "twenty"
   Extra Notes:    When multiple triggers exist that are identical except for
                   their wildcard character, the order of priorities are that
                   _ is always first, # is second, and * last. So in this code
                   and the following one, the "i am # years old" should match
                   if the wildcard is a number and the "i am * years old" should
                   only match otherwise.
*/
+ i am * years old
